# SE Project React

## 📌 Overview

SE Project React is a front-end application built with **React** that allows users to look for the weather forecast in their area. The app helps the user decide what clothing to wear based on the information provided by the Openweather API. The project emphasizes component-based design, modern styling practices, and clean file organization.

## 🚀 Project Features and Technologies

- **React** (functional components, hooks, props, state management)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **REST API integration**
- **Responsive design with CSS and BEM methodology**
- **Reusable components for UI consistency**
- **Environment variable support for API configuration**

---

## 🎨 Styling and File Organization

- **BEM (Block-Element-Modifier)** methodology for naming consistency.
- **CSS files grouped by component** for modular styling.
- **Global styles** kept minimal to avoid conflicts.
- **Responsive layout** ensuring usability across devices.

---

## 🔗 API Interactive Functionality

- Fetches data dynamically from an external API.
- Provides error handling for failed requests.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (At a Glance)

1. **User loads app** → React initializes UI components.
2. **API requests sent** → Fetch user data, cards, or other resources.
3. **Data rendered dynamically** → Updates React state for real-time display.
4. **UI updates** → Reflects latest server-side changes instantly.

## 🌐 API Base and Auth

- **Authentication**: Uses API key/token stored in environment variables.

## 🛠️ Plan on Improving the Project

- Add **user authentication (login/signup)** for personalized experiences.
- Implement **pagination or infinite scroll** for API-heavy pages.
- Add **unit and integration tests** (Jest + React Testing Library).
- Expand **API-driven features** such as comments or advanced search.
- Enhance **UI/UX** with light/dark mode themes.
- Optimize performance with **React.lazy** and code splitting.
